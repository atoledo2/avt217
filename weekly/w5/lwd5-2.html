 <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
 	<p>This week I am <b>extremely</b> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
 	<p>Next month, we will be serving <mark><em><b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b></em></mark>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2021-11-30">November 30</time></p>
