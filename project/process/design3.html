	<h1>Mockup 1 Revision</h1>
	<p><img src="home3.png"></p>
	<p>I decided the homepage should be the portfolio page to avoid confusion, also added a footer with copyright information and email and LinkedIn buttons</p>
	<p><img src="about3.png"></p>
	<p> The about page hasn't changed much, my name is now on the header on all pages and repeated in About. Also now there is a button for my resume.</p>
	<p><img src="contact3.png"></p>
	<p>There's a contact page alone where the user can type a message and also bigger buttons for my email and LinkedIn.</p>
