	<h1>Refined Mockup</h1>
	<p>I decided to mix both of my mockups, but leaning towards my second design. I took mockup 2 and changed the color pallete to the same as mockup 1 as well as the layout of some items. </p>
	<p><img src="home-final.png"></p>
	<p>The first thing I did was move my name closer to my logo to create some association. My name now is under the logo so it looks like it's part of it. I tried to have less negative space, following some feedback I received.</p>
	<p><img src="portfolio-final.png"></p>
	<p> I made a grid in Illustrator with the guide lines and the ruler to try and mimic what madding and borders would do when I hace to code this page, partly to make it look better and partly to make it a little easier on me making my vision a reality. </p>

	<p>I'm considering using a short video as my picture, but I am not completely convinced yet. </p>
	<p><img src="contact-final.png"></p>
	<p>I replicated my layout of the contact page from my first mockup. I also added a send button since I forgot last time. The email and linkedin logos should redirect the user to the websites. </p>
