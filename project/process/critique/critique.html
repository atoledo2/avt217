		<h1>Restaurant Critiques</h1>
	</header>
		<h2><a href="https://www.silverdiner.com/">Silver Diner</a></h2>

		<p>This page is easy to naviagte, most items are in grids and it has a consistent color scheme. It is easy to find their operative hours and locations as well as any adjustements to that location's hours. Their menu has a column with categories and the food appears on the remaining 2/3s of the screen with pictures and details of the dish, as well as markings for special dietary needs like vegan and dairy-free.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.sandwichrepublicva.com/">Sandwich Republic</a></h2>

		<p>The logo, phone, and address are accessible from all pages and tabs in the site. The layout overall is simple and clean, only using images when necessary or to accent text and information. The menu follows a grid system and is easy to navigate. The light brown color of the text makes it. </p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.outback.com/">Outback Steakhouse</a></h2>
		<img src="outback.jpg" alt="Outback Steakhouse" style="width:1100px;height:550px;">
		<p>The styling and colors in this website are consistent on every page. There are five choices on the header of the page for the menu, ordering online, rewards, specials, bar, and gift cards. Every page features a button of some sort, but it does not intervene with the user experience. The layout on every page follows a 2 or 3 grid layout. The size of the header feels a little too big at times, specially when there is a lot of scrolling involved.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.breezebakery.com/">Breeze Bakery</a></h2>
		<img src="breeze.jpg" alt="Breeze Bakery" style="width:1100px;height:550px;">
		<p>This site has a permanent banner on the top of the page with an update on their hours of operation. There are eight options on the header of the page and some of them such as "Menu" and "About" have submenus when hovering over them witht the mouse. The colors in the page are bright and it differenciates headings, subheadings, and regualr text by making the color of the text softer than the one before it, which at its lowest makes it hard to read. There is a banner on the top of the page that feels very dynamic because it cycles automatically and displays promotions. The menu is organized in 3 colums with pictures and information beneath them.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.tacobamba.com/">Taco Bamba</a></h2>
		<img src="taco.jpg" alt="Taco Bamba" style="width:1100px;height:550px;">
		<p>This website is bold in the approach they display their information and images. It relies on good pictures of their food to entice the user to click on the different options laid out by the bar on the left side of the screen. Some categories in this section even have drop-down menus of their own for more specifications, such as catering for a private even or a neighborhood event and an overview of their hours or help to locate the nearest restaurant near the customer. The contrasting colors of white text on a black background with minimal red accents make the information easy to read.</p>
