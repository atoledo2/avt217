	<h1>Mockup 2 Revision</h1>
	<p><img src="home4.png"></p>
	<p>I kept the contrast between the circles and squares for the sidebar and footer vs the body content. I added two links to the sidebar for my email and LinkedIn, they are repeated in the footer with some copyright information. 
	I think I should make the text a little smaller.</p>
	<p><img src="about4.png"></p>
	<p> I decided I would make a button that would go to an html of my portfolio or open it on another window instead of a picture of my portfolio inder my paragraph.</p>
	<p><img src="portfolio4.png"></p>
	<p>Now when someone visits my portfolio, if they hover over a picture it should darken and display the name of the piece. </p>
